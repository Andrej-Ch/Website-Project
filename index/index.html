                            translates web pages in audio. To us, bold text

                            Bold is a style and Strong is an indication of how

                            properties of the client used, instead of making a 
                            specific page for a specific client. CSS can query 
                            the client for its resolution, for example, to 
                            adjust for the layout of the page so it would appear
                            correctly on a phone and on a computer. It can 
                            adjust the position of pictures, the size of menus 
                            and to load specific content when viewed from

                            element using JQuery in an easier manner:</p>
                        <pre>
&dollar;( &quot;a&quot; ).click(function( event ) {
event.preventDefault()&semi;
                        </pre>
                        <p>This will disable any actions after clicking the

                        <p>JQuery is optimized to perform majority of JavaScript
                            common functions with fewer lines of code, therefore 
                            it’s faster and more time-efficient. The biggest 
                            difference between jQuery and JavaScript is that 
                            jQuery has been optimized to work with a variety of 
                            browsers automatically. Unfortunately, JavaScript 
                            still has some issues with cross-browser 
                            compatibility due to poor JavaScript implementation 
                            practices on the part of web browser developers.</p>

                            to JavaScript. Like JavaScript (and unlike Java), 
                            Python supports a programming style that uses simple 
                            functions and variables without engaging in class 
                            definitions. However, for JavaScript, that's all 
                            there is. Python, on the other hand, supports writing
                            much larger programs and better code reuse through a 
                            true object-oriented programming style, where classes

                            for use. Host objects are object supplied by the host

                            numeric values. You can use it in combination

                            be used later in JavaScript code. Alternatively,
                            you can create a Number object simply by setting

                        <h4>Boolean:</h4>
                        <p>The Boolean object is necessary when attempting 
                            to create any sort of logic in JavaScript. A 
                            Boolean is an object that represents a true or a
                            false value. The Boolean object has a number of 
                            values that qualify as a value equal to false 
                            (<code>0</code> , <code>-0</code>, 
                            <code>null</code>, or <code>" "</code> 
                            (an empty string)), undefined , and of course,

                        <p>IPv6 was introduced because the amount of IPv4 
                            addresses is becoming exhausted. IPv4 uses 32-bit 
                            addresses which provide ~4.3 billion addresses, 
                            which is clearly not enough, as of December, 2014, 
                            IPv4 still carries 94% of the internet`s traffic. 
                            Something needed to be done so that there would be 
                            more IP addresses available, hence IPv6 was 
                            introduced. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses which would 
                            be roughly enough to give an IP address to every 
                            particle in our universe. IPv6 does not just 
                            introduce a larger amount of IP addresses available,
                            it also has some technical upgrades. IPv6 permits 
                            hierarchical address allocation methods that 
                            facilitate route aggregation across the Internet, 
                            and so limit the expansion of routing tables. The 
                            use of multicast addressing is expanded and 
                            simplified, and provides additional optimization for
                            the delivery of services. Device mobility, security,
                            and configuration aspects have been considered in 
                            the design of the protocol. The issue which is 
                            making the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 difficult is
                            that IPv6 was not designed to be interoperable with 
                            IPv6, but there are many ways being explored how to 
                            ease this transition. One is that an IPv4 packet 
                            could carry an IPv6 packet inside of it, using IPv4 
                            as a link layer for IPv6, this is called Tunneling. 
                            Another method is called Dual IP stack 
                            implementation, it provides that IPv4 and IPv6 can 
                            both run side by side using the same network 
                            infrastructure and this is the most desirable way.</p>

                    <div class="main">
                        <h4>Idempotence:</h4>
                        <p>Methods having the property of <em><q>idempotence</q></em> means 
                            that (aside from error or expiration issues) the 
                            side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same
                            as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT 
                            and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods 
                            OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and 
                            so are inherently idempotent.</p>
                        <h4>Simplifying HTTP proxy caching:</h4>
                        <p>The basic purpose of HTTP caching is to provide a 
                            mechanism for applications to scale better and 
                            perform faster. But HTTP caching is applicable only 
                            to idempotent requests, which makes a lot of sense; 
                            only idempotent and nullipotent requests yield the 
                            same result when run multiple times. In the HTTP 
                            world, this fact means that GET requests can be 
                            cached but POST requests cannot. </p>
                        <h4>Visitor counters:</h4>
                        <p>Since the result of the GET method is exactly the 
                            same after each time it is performed, the results 
                            can easily be cached. By implementing a visitor 
                            counter, the result will actually be different from 
                            other requests, so you shouldn't cache it.</p>
                        <h4>Negative effect from proxies:</h4>
                        <p>A proxy allows multiple visitors access the page 
                            using the same IP address, they are seen as the same
                            visitor. The consequence of this is that the visitor
                            counter is not increased.</p>

                            can be made easier with them. Cookies are used to

                            have to log-in every time they visit the page.

                            websites he/she visits. The drawbacks of cookies can
                            be, that they can impede the privacy of the user by 
                            tracking his actions – visited pages etc… The user 
                            does not always know how the cookies will be used and

                        <h4>a)</h4>
                        <p>One thing that needs improvement: tokenizer 
                            recognizes apostrophe [ ' ] as a punctuation mark, 
                            therefore words that use it are divided in two words. For example <em><q>it’ll</q></em> 
                            is counted as two words <em><q>it</q></em>  and <em><q>ll</q></em> ,  <em><q>don’t</q></em>  is 
                            divided into <em><q>don</q></em> and <em><q>t</q></em> . As words with apostrophe 
                            are common in English language, we get inaccurate 
                            results.</p>
                        <h4>b)</h4>
                        <p>There is no single universal list of stop-words
                            used by all language processing tools, 
                            so it’s difficult to draw the line. However majority of
                            top-30 words from this book belong in stop word list
                            , especially the five most frequent ones: <em><q>the, and,
                            to, a, it</q></em>. Less common words could be included in 
                            language processing at some cases, for example 
                            phrase search. One word that stands out, and 
                            shouldn’t be considered a stop word is <em><q>Alice</q></em>, 
                            because it is a vital part of the book.</p>

                        <p>Internationalization is achieved when the design of content, application, specification etc., provides easy access and usage to users who come from different cultures and regions and speak different languages.
						Internationalization raises several issues to be addressed for web designers and developers. Making a web application comprehensible for people who speak different languages can be a challenging task. Although Unicode, which is the main computing industry standard behind W3C technologies, allows the storage of different characters and symbols in a slightly different order, it cannot ensure the canonical equivalence of the resulting sequences. When the key issue of canonical equivalence is not handled, it may lead to incorrect parsing, comparing and sorting of text.
						Additionally, different writing systems require different text alignment. For example, arabic is written and read from right to left. A combination of text alignment and other typographic conventions should be supported in the style sheets of a mark up language. A mark up language should also allow the input and representation of different formats of data, such as alternative calendars.
						The translatable content should be comprehensible. Different languages use different syntax. As a result, the web appications should not be restricted to an english based syntax.
						Cultural issues may occur next to the above mentioned linguistic problems. Symbolism is an example of cultural controversy. (e.g. a checkmark could indicate something incorrect in Japanese culture.)</p>

                        <h4>MySpace.com</h4>
                        <p>Created on 1996, offering web design services to businesses.
							On 1999 MySpace introduced the ability for customers to create their own, personal, profiles. By the time of March, 2000, MySpace went offline for maintenance and was not online until May of the same year. The biggest feature introduced was the ability for the users to receive 300mb of personal space for file uploads. Later in August, MySpace changed its colour theme from red to blue and started to look in the way of businesses again by introducing two new features. Business Solutions was one of the two newly introduced services and it offered businesses to organise, store and distribute information. The other service that was introduced was called Inbox, it offered the ability to share the data between the users, a bit like an email application. On September an agreement was made with Fujifilm to utilise DLTtape(TM)IV data cartridges for backing up customers data. A year later, MySpace had once more went offline. The only page found on the URL was a form which let the users apply for new on the development of the page. A partnership with e.io storage was announced and it offered online data storage and sharing with the possibility of a custom API. Also an agreement was formed with KiTechCafe for physical storage devices.</p>
							<p>By 2002, MySpace was completely empty and from September, the only displayed item was a message saying "Welcome to MySpace". Two years later, in 2004, MySpace was 	introduced, for the first time, as a social network for creating user profiles, finding friends and sharing photos, much like the modern day iterations. On June, the possibility to create blogs and share music was introduced. Two more years after that, in 2006, the site promoted music videos and bands which were popular at the time. In 2007, the sharing of user videos was introduced and they were ranked according to their views. The trending videos were showed on the welcome page, much like YouTube.</p>
							<p>By 2008, MySpace`s users had the possibility to find famous movies and actors, sort of like imdb.com. A year later this was broadened to be able to follow updates of celebrities and in 2010, MySpace distanced itself from the social networking side and started to promote music, films and radio stations. The design of the page has changed multiple times since then.</p>

                        <p>We chose online used book shop website <a href="http://www.thriftbooks.com">www.thriftbooks.com</a>. We will try to improve sales by modifying overall outlook of the book select list.</p>
							<h4>Default style of the page:</h4>
							 <figure>
								<img src='images/books.png'/>
							</figure>
							<p>A book cover, with titles and their authors. Lower we can see the price and a button that redirects user to sales page. Our goal is to and reorganize general outlook and improve visibility.</p></p>
							<p>Some things may need improvement:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Titles are too small and feel overshadowed by authors name. The title of the book is main search criteria for a user, so we want to increase its visibility. </li></p>
								<li>Removing unnecessary text – Information about edition of the book (e.g. <i>Fourth Edition, Dover Thrift edition</i>) takes up additional space in the title box and should be showed only at extended view of the book.</li></p>
								<li>Book cover is too small, and looks out of line with text and button. Slightly increasing its size would provide better visual information for the user. 
								</li>
							</ul>	</p></br>
							<h4>Updated view:</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src='images/books2.png'/>
							</figure>
							<p><b>Changes made:</b> Increased title font, changed to more pronounced style, removed text about edition order, increased book cover image size.</p>
							<p>We believe that improved clarity and optimized visual cues could influence conversion rates in a positive way.</>
							<p> We can test it by creating a new page with added improvements, and adding it to the website. Both pages should be tested simultaneously for extended period of time(for example 1 month). Each visitor will be randomly redirected to one of pages, and “cookied” to always see the same page in multiple visits.  For significant changes like page layout reformatting, it is recommended to use the updated version only on new visitors, but since our improvements are mild, even regular visitors wont be shocked by sudden changes. </p>
							<p>To measure performance between two pages we would count the redirection to sales page (button clicks). If new version generates larger interest in sales, we would adapt it as a permanent part of website.</p></p>
							<h4>Other possible ideas for A/B testing:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Bigger/differently styled "Choose a copy" button.</li>
								<li>More pronounced price numbers.</li>
								<li>Book cover image magnification on mouse hover.</li>
							</ul>

						<h4>The Magnifying-Glass Icon in Search Design: Pros and Cons</h4>
                        <p>Having a well placed and simple “Search” bar on your website is vital. There are many ways we can approach designing our own search bar:</p>
							<figure>
								<img src='images/search_samples.png' height="170" width="300">
							</figure></p>
						<p>According to Katie Sherwin article <i>"The Magnifying-Glass Icon in Search Design: Pros and Cons"</i> (<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/magnifying-glass-icon">http://www.nngroup.com/articles/magnifying-glass-icon</a>) the main guidelines for effective search bar are:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Have an easily identifiable search box in the upper right-hand corner of the page, with an open-text field accompanied by a Search button.</li>
								<li>The search box needs no label. A clear Search button next to the field identifies the search for the user and tells them how to execute the search.</li></p>
							</ul></p>
						<p>Other important things to consider when creating a search bar:</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
								<li>Replacing actual “Search” button with magnifying glass icon could make search bar less prominent and noticeable. However it has its own advantages; saving space when converting website for a mobile device with smaller screen. For international sites there is  no need to translate “search” button to other language, as magnifying glass icon is universal.</li></p>
								<li>Using simplest version of magnifying glass is recommended – fewer graphical details will increase user recognition time.</p> <p><img src='images/search.png' height="40" width="40"> &nbsp;VS&nbsp;  <img src='images/search2.png' height="40" width="40"> </li>
								<li>For search box to be more prominent it's recommended to use more contrast, sufficient padding, and search icon should be large enough for user to click it with no effort.</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<h4>Example page</h4>
							<figure>
								<img src='images/oculus.jpg'>
							</figure>
							<p>As an example I’m going to use search bar from <a href="https://share.oculus.com">https://share.oculus.com</a>.</p>
							<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:disc">	
									<li>The positioning of Search bar is up to standart (the upper right corner).</li>
									<li>The border and darker shading provides tolerable visibility.</li>	</ul></p>
							<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:disc">	
								<li>Lack of search text or icon makes it more difficult for user to identify search box.</li>
								<li>No button. User is forced to use ENTER key to execute search. User should be provided with both options - Enter key and mouse-clicking on the button/icon.</li>	</p>
								
							<h4>Adding an icon will improve visibility and functionality of the search bar:</h4>

							<h4>Most brick-and-mortar shops of books, games and music are forced to focus and sell only a few best-selling products. Why can the long tail still be profitable for on-line shops?</h3>
							<p>It all comes to convenience. A so called brick-and-mortar shops have limited space and therefore cannot afford to keep every single item. Retailers work for maximum profit in shortest periods of time, and will offer customers most desirable options. However on-line shops have an unlimited “shelf” space, therefore they can display even most unique items for years.</p>

							<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he had left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet and its predecessor ARPANET.</p>
							<p>W3C tries to enforce compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how Web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.</p>
							<p>W3C does not have a typical organizational structure, nor is it incorporated. In administrative terms: W3C is administered via a joint agreement among these "Host Institutions": MIT , ERCIM , Keio University, and Beihang University. The W3C staff (many of whom work physically at one of these institutions) is led by a Director and CEO. A small management team is responsible for resource allocation and strategic planning on behalf of the staff. Regional offices play an important role in W3C being an international organization.</p>
							<p> Companies both benefit and work together with W3c. They help to accelerates= development and integration in projects with software solutions, show their support for standards and for W3C through a variety of means, including participation in groups, sponsorship of events, chairing groups, and implementing specifications.</p>

                        <p>The basic principle of Net Neutrality is that access to all websites and web services should be equal and that anyone can start their own website/service and make it accessible to anyone with internet access, just like any other website/service. </p>
						<p>Without Net Neutrality, your Internet Service Provider could arbitrarily block whatever websites it didn't want you to access (e.g. perhaps blocking you from accessing competitors' websites). It could also mean your service provider purposefully degrades access to certain websites or services and/or forces you to pay extra to access certain websites or services. This could be exploited for financial or political purposes.</p>

							<li>Apple insists that they want to give their users a choice, to purchase e-newspaper through iTunes, or directly from newspapers’ own websites.  ENPA is worried that Apple will allow users to buy papers directly from publishers, and this would largely cut into newspapers profit.</li>
							<li>Allowing consumers to only have access to the newspaper of their choice via the iTunes store, is a major violation of net neutrality principals, as all data should be treated equally regardless of how user gains access to it.</li>

                        <p>Differently from iTunes Spotify does not allow user to download music, but rather streams it online. It could be a great way for upcoming artists to get recognition and some financial gain,  however they  aren’t as supportive to artists as they claim to be. </p>
						<p>Spotify pays musicians  ~0.5 cent per play ($5,000 per million plays) and they have received a lot of criticism over the years, because the biggest piece of cake goes to major labels and recording companies via licensing fees (over US$1bn paid out by 2013), while artists are struggling. </p>
						<p>Spotify should open their own independent record company where they would collaborate directly with artists, so cutting out the middle man – major record labels. This way Spotify could save large amounts of money on licensing, and this would allow the artists to get paid what they deserve.</p>
